# Project Idea: Decentralized Media Sharing Platform

## Overview: 

Create a decentralized platform for sharing media files (images, videos, documents) securely using FileCoin for storage and Ethereum for smart contract functionality.
Users can upload, store, and share media files while maintaining ownership and control over their data.

## Key Features:

- File Storage and Retrieval: Use FileCoin for decentralized storage and retrieval of media files.
- Ownership and Access Control: Implement smart contracts on Ethereum to manage file ownership and access permissions.
- User Authentication: Use decentralized identity management for secure user authentication.
- Payment Integration: Integrate a payment system using Ethereum for premium features or extra storage.

## Technologies

- Frontend: React.js for building an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- Backend: Node.js and Express for server-side logic.
- Storage: FileCoin, web3.storage or lighthouse for decentralized storage.
- Blockchain: Ethereum for smart contracts (Solidity), FEVM (Filecoin Ethereum Virtual Machine) if needed.
- Authentication: uPort or similar for decentralized identity management.
- Payment Integration: Integrate with MetaMask for Ethereum transactions.

## Implementation Plan

1. File Storage and Retrieval
- Integrate FileCoinâ€™s web3.storage or lighthouse for storing media files.
- Create a user-friendly interface for uploading and retrieving files.
2. Smart Contract Development
- Develop smart contracts in Solidity to handle file ownership and access permissions.
- Deploy these smart contracts on the Ethereum network.
3. User Authentication and Access Control
- Implement decentralized authentication using uPort or similar tools.
- Ensure that only authorized users can access specific media files.
4. Payment Integration
- Integrate MetaMask to allow users to make payments for premium features or additional storage.
- Develop smart contracts to handle these transactions securely.
5. UI/UX Design
- Create an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user interface using React.js.
- Focus on a seamless user experience with easy navigation and clear instructions.
